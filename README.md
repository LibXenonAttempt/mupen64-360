this fork adds the "Xenonize" option that boots up the xenon.elf at the root of your USB drive, so with that you can 
switch to another app without rebooting
really helpful even if N64 games are all you need because if you want to pull out the USB, this emulator can't handle it,
my suggestion - use this: https://github.com/LibXenonAttempt/browser-example/releases
after switching to it stay at the root, unplug, transfer some data, plug back, launch xenon.elf, unplug and plug it back again until it starts,
might need to change the usb port

also compiled with more fresh libxenon fork which I think makes it work with the Winchester models(?)

how to set up:
1. get the browser-example on your usb, you can skip this one if n64 games are all you need
2. put the elf32 from Releases somewhere you know on the USB, if you skipped 1 name it xenon.elf and put at root, there's gotta be one for xell to run anything
3. not sure if you need anything else, I've just looked up mupen64-360 on google and got the mupen64-360 folder from there minus the elf
